name: "Visible: Pacing for illness"
author: "Visible Health"
description: "Visible is an “activity tracking platform for illness, not fitness”. Our mission is to help millions of people to measure and manage their energy-limiting illness. Our mobile app can be used in combination with a wearable heart rate monitor which helps people to implement an energy management strategy called “pacing”. The free app allows users to: - measure biometrics including HRV with a smartphone camera - track their symptoms and medication to spot patterns in their illness - contribute their data to research studies with academic institutions e.g. [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/246134/imperial-visible-launch-app-based-health-studies/) Users of the free app can upgrade to a paid membership to get the full benefit of illness management with a wearable heart rate monitor. This provides users with: - real-time activity guidance - energy budgeting and pacing - illness specific-metrics"
